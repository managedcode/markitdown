**General Specimen Submission Instructions**

**Specimen Collection – Special Considerations**

Adequate patient preparation, specimen collection and specimen are critical in achieving accurate test results.

Specimens should be collected prior to beginning antibiotics

Collect specimen in containers appropriate for the test requested.

Use swabs, media or collection containers with current expiration dates.

Hold specimens under correct conditions before transport.

Observe time restrictions on collection and transport.

**Specimen Identification/Labeling**

Label specimen container with the following information:

Patient’s first and last name or unique identifier

Patient’s date of birth (DOB) or **second** unique identifier

Date and time of collection (when appropriate)

Specimen source (when appropriate) (e.g. when sending more than one specimen for the same patient)

NOTE: Anonymous HIV testing is acceptable with only the unique identification number.

If possible, use a computer generated label to label all specimens. If that is not an option, please print legibly.

**Test Request Form – Complete the lab test request form as follows:**

Please print all information legibly. Computer generated labels may be used in place of hand written, provided all required information is provided.

Before specimen transport, verify that the names on the specimen and request form are in agreement.

Required Information

Patient’s first and last name or unique identifier

Patient Date of Birth and Patient ID or EPIC MRN or encounter # (FQHCs)

Patient Sex

Patient Race and Ethnicity

Pregnancy status (if applicable)

Patient Address – City and Zip Code are most critical

Date of Collection

Time of Collection (if appropriate)

Specimen Source

Submitter Location

Name of physician ordering test

Test requested

Diagnosis code

Some tests require the date of symptom onset (i.e. Norovirus).

**Reference Cultures – Please indicate test requested AND organism suspected on test request form**

Bacterial/Mycobacterial Isolates

Ensure that isolates are transported packaged in compliance with Division 6.2 Infectious Substance Shipping Guide requirements.

Please send an actively growing pure culture on solid test-tube media or broth.

MGIT tube, MB bottle, or actively growing isolate for TB ID.

Slide for Malaria ID in protective slide holder

Thick and thin stained smears preferred

Please include pertinent information related to clinical history, travel history, insect bites, etc.

**Blood, Serum, or Plasma Collected for Antibody or Molecular Assays**

**Acute Phase** – ASAP (no later than 7 days after symptom onset)

**Convalescent Phase –** 14-28 days after onset

Never freeze whole blood

Use ONLY plastic blood collection tubes

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for your specific blood collection tube

Specimens that are **hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated** will be rejected

**Wound or Abscess**

Collect fluid or aspirate into the appropriate sterile container.

Never collect material onto a dry swab.

**Transport**

Ensure the integrity of specimens before transport.

Secure tops on the EDTA blood lead tubes.

Tightly secure lids on urine containers.

Use parafilm as needed to prevent leakage.

**Temperature Requirements**: specific storage and transport requirements are provided under each test description.

All blood tubes need to be placed in a plastic conicaltransport tube. The green tube or other specimen container should be placed in a biohazard zip lock plastic bag.

Place completed Laboratory Test Request form in outside pocket of biohazard bag. DO NOT wrap the test request form around the specimen.

**Specimen Quality Assurance Criteria** - To assure quality testing and to meet Federal and State regulations, the Public Health Laboratory has strict requirements for specimen identification, as detailed below:

**When an unsatisfactory specimen is received, an effort is made to contact the submitter ASAP by telephone, email or fax in an attempt to reconcile the discrepancy. Unsatisfactory specimens will be held for 72 hours before being discarded.**

**If the specimen is determined to be “Unsatisfactory” the reason will be printed on the report.** If you receive a report with a result of “Unsatisfactory” please collect a new specimen with new paperwork to be sent to the lab.

The following specimens do not meet quality assurance standards.

Specimens that lack proper identification. Unlabeled specimens will not be tested.

Name or number on specimen not matching accompanied test request.

For partial mismatches, the submitter will be contacted to attempt to reconcile the information.

Name or identifier missing on specimen or test request.

Specimen with compromised quality:

Collected in improper container that is not suitable for test requested

Collected in expired container or on expired media

Not enough specimen in the container

Specimen containers that are broken, leaking or with evidence of contamination on outer surfaces or on request form

Clotted, hemolyzed, or hyperlipemic blood

Past the acceptable collection/transport time

Specimen transported under inappropriate conditions

Improper specimen for test requested

**Test “Turn Around Time” (TAT) -** Each test listed in the Test Request and Collection Guide has a projected TAT. This is the time from specimen receipt in the Public Health Laboratory to result entered into the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). This time is dependent on a non-holiday work week, courier pick up time of the specimens, time of day that the results are printed, and whether the specimen requires confirmatory testing.

Refer to the RUHS- DOPH Laboratory Fee Schedule for test prices and CPT codes.

All specimen referrals to CDPH or CDC laboratories **must** be processed and sent through the RUHS- DOPH Laboratory unless otherwise approved to be sent directly. Contact the Riverside Department of Public Health Laboratory 951-358-5070 and/or Disease Control 951-358-5107 prior to submitting specimens.

Specimens that are **hemolyzed, lipemic, or contaminated** will be rejected

Do not freeze whole blood. This will cause the specimen to hemolyze and be unacceptable for testing.

Use only plastic blood collection tubes.

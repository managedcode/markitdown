= Helios Navigation Operations Log

The *Helios Initiative* keeps a rolling log of navigation discussions that feed the `mission-outline.opml` planning tree and the shared `mission-wiki.wiki`. Crew members are expected to link each action item back to the authoritative references held in the `orbital-research.bib` bibliography.

== Morning Constellation Check

Date:: 2045-04-11
Location:: Jovian Transfer Corridor (Segment 3)

The navigation console reported a drift of _3.4 arcseconds_ relative to the expected reference frame. See the supporting telemetry in `telemetry-events.jsonl`. The correction burn is tracked as **MNV-2045-18** and detailed in the engineering briefing (`engineering-notes.rst`).

NOTE: The drift coincides with a spike in the magnetometer feed captured in the `resource-allocation.tsv` summary (Row `Helios-Gyro-17`).

== Star Tracker Calibration

* Inspect the optical assembly for ice crystals. If found, edit the [[../mission-operations.creole#Maintenance|Mission Operations Guide]].
* Record calibration coefficients in the `navigation-overview.typst` design spec.
* Upload snapshots to the archive referenced in `mission-summary.metamd`.

== Historical Context

The `explorer-journal.fb2` novella keeps a human-readable narrative of these entries, while the formal observation data is preserved in the XML pair `stellar-observation.docbook` and `stellar-observation.jats`. For the legislative compliance trail, consult the `mission-citations.csljson` auto-generated citation file.

TIP: During code freeze, ensure the guidance algorithm described in `navigation-theory.tex` matches the simplified example in `navigation-theory.latex`.

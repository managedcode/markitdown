====== Helios Daily Briefing ======

===== Overview =====
The Helios crew convenes each cycle to review navigation updates, science goals, and outstanding tasks. This DokuWiki page is mirrored in the OPML tree ([[../mission-outline.opml]]) and summarised in the MetaMarkdown file ([[../mission-summary.metamd]]). The facilitation checklist lives in the Textile guide ([[../crew-handbook.textile]]).

\section{Burn Planning Model}
The maneuver sequence computed in this document serves as the authoritative reference for the operational log found in \texttt{celestial-navigation-notes.adoc}. Telemetry values originate from the JSONL and NDJSON feeds, and final results are posted to the MetaMarkdown summary.

The total required delta-v is
\[
  \Delta v_\text{total} = \sqrt{(\Delta v_x)^2 + (\Delta v_y)^2 + (\Delta v_z)^2},
\]
where each component is derived from the momentum exchange recorded in \texttt{telemetry-events.jsonl}.

\subsection{Constraint Checks}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Verify burn window openings with the mission outline (\texttt{mission-outline.opml}).
  \item Confirm resource availability in \texttt{resource-allocation.tsv}---the Creole operations guide references the same table.
  \item Annotate anomalies in \texttt{engineering-notes.rst} for archival in the DocBook handbook.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Cross References}
\begin{itemize}
  \item PlantUML sequence (\texttt{deployment-diagram.puml}) captures the live escalation for deviations.
  \item Bibliographic references include ellison2045 and nguyen2044 as catalogued in \texttt{orbital-research.bib} and \texttt{mission-citations.csljson}.
  \item Training content synchronized with metadata file \texttt{youtube-solid-principles.json}.
\end{itemize}

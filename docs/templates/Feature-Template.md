## Implementation plan (step-by-step)

> TEMPLATE ONLY — replace these checkboxes with real implementation steps for this feature and keep them updated while implementing.

- [ ] Analyze current behaviour (facts)
- [ ] Finalize spec (rules/flows/diagram/verification)
- [ ] Implement the feature (smallest safe increments)
- [ ] Add/update automated tests for each scenario (happy + negative + edge)
- [ ] Run verification commands (build/test/format/analyze/coverage) and record results
- [ ] Update docs (Feature/ADRs/Architecture overview) and close the checklist

## Purpose

Short description of the business problem and value.

## Stakeholders (who needs this to be clear)

| Role | What they need from this spec |
| --- | --- |
| Product / Owner | Scope, acceptance criteria, user-visible behaviour |
| Engineering | Modules, contracts, data, error handling, edge cases |
| DevOps / SRE | Config, rollout plan, monitoring/alerts, rollback |
| QA | Executable test flows (positive/negative/edge) + environment |

## Scope

## Business Rules

- Rule 1
- Rule 2
- Rule 3

## User Flows

### Primary flows

1. Flow name  
   - Actor: User / Service  
   - Trigger:  
   - Steps:  
   - Result:  

### Edge cases

- Edge case → Expected behaviour

## System Behaviour

- Entry points: API endpoints / UI / events / scheduled jobs  
- Reads from: DB / service / cache  
- Writes to: DB / service / queue  
- Side effects / emitted events:  
- Idempotency: Yes/No + conditions  
- Error handling: rules + user-facing messages  
- Security / permissions: AuthZ rules  
- Feature flags / toggles: names + defaults  
- Performance / SLAs:  
- Observability: logs/metrics/traces that must exist

## Diagrams

> TEMPLATE ONLY — Mermaid often breaks with fancy syntax. Keep it simple and make sure it renders in the repo.

## Verification

This section is mandatory: describe how to test (scenarios + commands).

### Test environment

- Environment / stack (local compose / staging / cloud env):  
- Data and reset strategy (seed data, fixtures, migration steps):  
- External dependencies (real / sandbox / fake services required):  

### Test commands

- build: (paste from `AGENTS.md`)
- test: (paste from `AGENTS.md`)
- format: (paste from `AGENTS.md`)
- coverage: (paste from `AGENTS.md`; delete if none)

### Test flows

**Positive scenarios**

| ID | Description | Level (Unit / Int / API / UI) | Expected result | Data / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POS-001 | Happy path | Integration | Outcome observed via public interface | Data / fixtures |

**Negative scenarios**

| ID | Description | Level (Unit / Int / API / UI) | Expected result | Data / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NEG-001 | Validation failure | API | Error response / code | Invalid input example |

**Edge cases**

| ID | Description | Level (Unit / Int / API / UI) | Expected result | Data / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EDGE-001 | Boundary condition | Integration | Expected behaviour at boundary | Data / timing notes |

### Test mapping

- Integration tests:  
- API tests:  
- UI / E2E tests:  
- Unit tests:  
- Static analysis:  

### Non-functional checks

Include this section only if it applies to this feature; otherwise remove it.

- Performance / load (tool, threshold, command):  
- Security / privacy (threats to verify):  
- Observability (log/metric assertions):  

---

## Definition of Done

- Behaviour matches rules and flows in this document.  
- All test flows above are covered by automated tests (Integration / API / UI as applicable).  
- Static analysis passes with no new unresolved issues.  
- Test and build commands listed above run clean in local and CI environments.  
- Documentation updated: this feature doc, related ADRs, Testing / API / Architecture docs, `AGENTS.md` if rules or patterns changed.  
- Feature flags / migrations rolled out or cleaned up.
